OC Maker (https://www.ocmaker.net) is an AI-powered character creator that allows users to design unique original characters. By providing text descriptions, our character maker generates personalized character images, serving as an intuitive OC generator for artists, writers, and gamers.

Currently, our AI generates images based on the text descriptions provided. We are continuously working to enhance customization features and appreciate user feedback to improve our services.

When you first create your OC, you can input specific prompts or descriptions that will guide the AI in generating the character's appearance, clothing, accessories, and other visual elements. After generating the initial image and before animating, you may have the option to make further adjustments or provide additional prompts to refine the character's look to your liking before proceeding to the animation stage.

After generating your Original Character (OC) image on our website, you can animate it by following these steps:

1. Locate the "Animate This Character" button on the OC image page.
2. Click the "Animate This Character" button to enter the video generation tool.
3. Input your animation prompt or script that describes the actions or expressions you want your character to have in the video.
4. Click the animate button to start the video creation process.
5. Once the animation is complete, you will be able to download or share your animated OC video in MP4 format.
